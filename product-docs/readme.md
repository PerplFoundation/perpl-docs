# README

API documentation for the Perpl perpetual futures exchange on Monad.

## Overview

The Perpl API provides two communication channels:

| Channel   | Protocol | Purpose                                  | Auth Required |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| REST API  | HTTPS    | History queries, authentication, profile | Varies        |
| WebSocket | WSS      | Real-time data, trading                  | Varies        |

**Base URL**: Configured via environment (see [Configuration](./#configuration))

Code examples for JavaScript, Rust, Python and TypeScript can be found in examples/

## Quick Start

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
## Get Market Data (No Auth)

```typescript
const API_URL = process.env.PERPL_API_URL || 'https://app.perpl.xyz/api';

// Fetch context (markets, tokens, chain config)
const context = await fetch(`${API_URL}/v1/pub/context`)
  .then(r => r.json());

console.log(context.markets); // Available markets
console.log(context.chain);   // Chain configuration
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Connect to Market Data WebSocket

```typescript
const WS_URL = process.env.PERPL_WS_URL || 'wss://app.perpl.xyz';

const ws = new WebSocket(`${WS_URL}/ws/v1/market-data`);

ws.onopen = () => {
  // Subscribe to BTC order book (market_id=1 on mainnet)
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    mt: 5, // MsgTypeSubscriptionRequest
    subs: [{ stream: 'order-book@1', subscribe: true }]
  }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Message type:', msg.mt);
};
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Authenticate (Required for Trading)

Programmatic clients authenticate with **API keys** (an Ed25519 key pair). You enroll the public key once — authorized by a one-time wallet signature — and then sign every request with the private key. There is no session cookie or bearer token.

Create a key from the web UI (**mainnet** [app.perpl.xyz/apikeys](https://app.perpl.xyz/apikeys), **testnet** [testnet.perpl.xyz/apikeys](https://testnet.perpl.xyz/apikeys)). Third-party integrations can enroll keys programmatically — see [**Integrations**](/broken/pages/9cc1621507a182d4c7246a140f64b42fe0789c99). For how to sign each request with a key, see [**Authentication**](/broken/pages/6451fe9ea080b784a1e900a84b80004c6003d02a).

```typescript
import * as ed from '@noble/ed25519';
import { createHash, randomBytes } from 'crypto';

const API_URL = process.env.PERPL_API_URL || 'https://app.perpl.xyz/api';
const CHAIN_ID = Number(process.env.PERPL_CHAIN_ID) || 143;

// An enrolled key (from the web UI or Integrations enrollment), read from the environment:
const API_KEY = process.env.PERPL_API_KEY;                    // the opaque X-API-Key token
const privateKey = Buffer.from((process.env.PERPL_API_KEY_SECRET ?? '').replace(/^0x/, ''), 'hex'); // Ed25519 private key

// Sign the canonical string and send the four X-API-* headers.
const target = '/v1/trading/fills?count=1';
const timestamp = Date.now().toString();
const nonce = randomBytes(16).toString('base64url');
const bodyHash = createHash('sha256').update('').digest('hex');
const canonical = [CHAIN_ID, 'GET', target, timestamp, nonce, bodyHash].join('\n');
const sig = await ed.signAsync(Buffer.from(canonical), privateKey);

const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}${target}`, {
   headers: {
      'X-API-Key': API_KEY,
      'X-API-Timestamp': timestamp,
      'X-API-Nonce': nonce,
      'X-API-Signature': Buffer.from(sig).toString('base64url'),
   },
});

console.log(await response.json());
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Successful API authentication does **not** mean you have an exchange account, and an exchange account alone does **not** mean you can post orders through this API — order forwarding must also be enabled on-chain. See [API Auth vs Smart Contract Account](./#api-auth-vs-smart-contract-account) below. Some calls will return 404 if a Smart Contract Account has not been created.

{% endstep %}

## Configuration

All URLs and chain settings are configurable via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable                 | Default                     | Description              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |

## Network Configuration

Perpl runs on both **Mainnet** (default) and **Testnet**.

|            | Mainnet (default)                                   | Testnet                                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| REST API   | `https://app.perpl.xyz/api`                         | `https://testnet.perpl.xyz/api`                    |
| WebSocket  | `wss://app.perpl.xyz`                               | `wss://testnet.perpl.xyz`                          |

| Exchange   | `0x34B6552d57a35a1D042CcAe1951BD1C370112a6F`        | `0x1964c32f0be608e7d29302aff5e61268e72080cc`       |
| Collateral | `0x00000000eFE302BEAA2b3e6e1b18d08D69a9012a` (AUSD) | `0xdf5b718d8fcc173335185a2a1513ee8151e3c027` (USD) |

To use testnet, set the environment variables to testnet values.

## Markets

Market IDs differ between networks:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Mainnet" %}
| Market ID | Symbol |
| --------- | ------ |
| 1         | BTC    |
| 10        | MON    |
| 20        | ETH    |
| 31        | SOL    |
| 40        | HYPE   |
| 50        | ZEC    |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Testnet" %}
| Market ID | Symbol |
| --------- | ------ |
| 16        | BTC    |
| 32        | ETH    |
| 48        | SOL    |
| 64        | MON    |
| 256       | ZEC    |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Fees & fee tiers

Trading fees are **per market** and **per fee tier**. Two things determine the rate on a fill: the market's fee schedule (`MarketConfig`) and the account's own fee tier (`Account.ft`).

Fees are charged on **every fill that changes a position's size**, in either direction: opening and increasing are charged on the size added, closing and reducing on the size removed. A close pays out of its own proceeds rather than your free balance, so it can never fail for lack of fee. Whether the maker or taker rate applies is decided at match time and reported per fill (`Fill.l`: 1 = maker, 2 = taker).

Liquidations, deleveraging and unwinds are **not** charged a trading fee.

### Reading the rate

`MarketConfig` carries the whole schedule, in **micros** (`10^-6` fractions; `1000` = 0.1% = 10 bps):

```typescript
maker_fee: Micros;      // base tier, equals maker_fees[0]
taker_fee: Micros;      // base tier, equals taker_fees[0]
maker_fees?: Micros[];  // one entry per fee tier, index 0 = base
taker_fees?: Micros[];  // one entry per fee tier, index 0 = base
```

`Account.ft` is that account's tier — an **index into those arrays**, where `0` is the base rate and higher tiers are progressively discounted. Together they let you compute your own effective rate without any extra endpoint:

```typescript
// market: from /api/v1/pub/context or the market-config stream (mt: 8)
// account: from the WalletSnapshot (mt: 19) or an account update (mt: 21)
function feeMicros(market: Market, account: Account, isMaker: boolean): number {
  const tiers = isMaker ? market.config.maker_fees : market.config.taker_fees;
  const base  = isMaker ? market.config.maker_fee  : market.config.taker_fee;
  // The arrays are omitted until the schedule has been indexed — fall back to base.
  return tiers?.[account.ft] ?? base;
}

// Fee on a fill, in collateral units. Same formula whichever direction the
// fill moves the position; the notional is the amount (price * size) the fill
// added or removed:
//   fee = notional * feeMicros / 1_000_000
```

The arrays are `omitempty`: treat a missing array as "base tier only" rather than as an error, and range-check `ft` against the array length before indexing.

### How a tier is assigned

* Tiers are earned from **rolling 14-day trading volume**, re-evaluated periodically in the background — not per order. Published thresholds are at [docs.perpl.xyz/exchange/fees](https://docs.perpl.xyz/exchange/fees).
* A change reaches you as an ordinary **account update** (`mt: 21`) with a new `ft`. Re-read it from every update instead of caching the snapshot value; it is resolved on-chain at fill time, so a stale local copy only affects your own cost estimates.

### What you are charged, as reported

Fee amounts on `Order` (`mt: 24`), `Fill` (`mt: 25`) and `AccountEvent` are **gross**: `f` is the total paid, protocol fee **plus** any builder fee, with the builder portion broken out as `bfa` (and lifetime as `tbf` inside `tf` on `AccountStats`). Never add `f` and `bfa` together. See [Integrations → Builder codes](/broken/pages/9cc1621507a182d4c7246a140f64b42fe0789c99#builder-codes).

Positions report fees differently from trades: `fee` covers the entry side and `cfee` the closing side, and what each carries depends on whether you are reading a live position or a position event. See [Fees on a position](/broken/pages/a35c61fcf85eaa8d16498afeebfd270f5e25a0c0#fees-on-a-position).

## Rate Limits

### WebSocket

Trading and market data are **separate servers with separate limits**. Sizing a market-data client against the trading numbers will get it closed.

**Trading** (`/ws/v1/trading`):

|             | Testnet              | Mainnet              |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Requests    | 60/min               | 120/min              |
| Connections | 4 per wallet address | 4 per wallet address |

The connection cap is keyed on the owning **wallet address**, not the individual key. Every API key enrolled on a wallet shares one budget of 4, and logged-in browser sessions count against the same budget — a desk running two keys does not get 8 connections.

Higher limits may be available for market makers — contact Perpl.

**Market data** (`/ws/v1/market-data`) — per connection, identical on testnet and mainnet:

|               | Limit  |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Requests      | 10/min |
| Subscriptions | 16     |

Application-level pings count toward the request budget, so a 30s keep-alive spends 2 of the 10. Market-data connections do not need one — see [Keep-Alive](/broken/pages/daecbdc03d39e92516bbf05b8f6afe85bb178aae#keep-alive).

Exceeding a **request-rate** limit closes the connection with code `1008` and no per-request status — anything in flight is lost silently. See [WebSocket Close Codes](./#websocket-close-codes) for the reason strings.

The **subscription** cap does not close the connection. The individual subscribe fails inside the `mt: 6` SubscriptionResponse with `code: 429` (`too many subscriptions`) and the socket stays usable — unsubscribe from something and retry.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use Change orders instead of Post + Cancel.
{% endhint %}

### REST

REST requests are rate-limited at the edge. Limits are not published and may change without notice — treat HTTP 429 as the signal and back off exponentially (example below).

**A batch of orders costs one unit of the allowance per order**, being the work one request would have carried. Batching over [`POST /v1/trading/orders`](/broken/pages/3ef674fd3bc6a5a9038554b57f0fb85f991387af#post-apiv1tradingorders) saves round trips; it does not raise the rate at which orders may be submitted. The allowance is charged as the batch is processed, so a batch that outruns it is served up to that point and the remaining orders are answered `429` **in their own positions** — the request as a whole is still HTTP 200.

```typescript
// Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff
async function fetchWithRetry(url: string, options: RequestInit, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    const res = await fetch(url, options);
    if (res.status === 429) {
      const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 4s
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, delay));
      continue;
    }
    return res;
  }
  throw new Error('Rate limit exceeded after retries');
}
```

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning                                                                           |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | Success                                                                           |
| 400  | Bad Request                                                                       |
| 401  | Unauthorized - bad/stale signature, replayed nonce, or revoked/expired key        |
| 403  | Forbidden - scope insufficient                                                    |
| 404  | Not Found                                                                         |
| 429  | Too Many Requests                                                                 |
| 500  | Internal Server Error                                                             |
| 503  | Service Unavailable - the service has not caught up with the chain yet. Retryable |

`503` is answered while a service is still warming up: a market's book or state has not been received yet, or the order gateway does not know the current exchange block. It is temporary and retrying later is expected to succeed — treat it as back-off, not as a failed request. It is also a `Status` code in its own right on the WebSocket and batch-order responses, not only an HTTP status.

### WebSocket Close Codes

| Code | Reason                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1008 | `too many requests`    | Request rate limit exceeded                                                                                                                                       |
| 1008 | `too many connections` | Connection cap exceeded                                                                                                                                           |
| 1008 | `ping timeout`         | No response to the server's ping                                                                                                                                  |
| 1008 | `idle timeout`         | No frame received within the idle window (5s mainnet, 10s testnet). Applies to the initial sign-in frame too                                                      |
| 1011 | `failed to process`    | Unknown market, an account not owned by the connected wallet, or an unparseable frame                                                                             |
| 1013 | `send buffer overflow` | The client is not reading fast enough: its send buffer stayed full for the whole server I/O timeout. Retry after a pause, and consume messages faster (see below) |
| 1001 | —                      | Server going away — the instance is shutting down. Reconnect immediately, no back-off needed                                                                      |
| 3401 | `unauthorized`         | Authentication failure                                                                                                                                            |

`1013` is back-pressure, not a rejection of anything you sent: the socket is closed because the server could not hand off messages destined for the client. It is reached either by falling behind on a busy stream, or by pipelining requests faster than the replies are read. Read frames off the socket promptly into your own queue rather than processing them inline, and subscribe only to the streams you consume.

A close carries no per-request status. Any request in flight when the socket closes is lost silently — reconcile against `mt: 24` / snapshots after reconnecting, do not assume it was dropped.

A close code of `1006` (abnormal closure, no close frame) is never sent by the server: it means the connection was lost at the network level, or the close frame could not be delivered. Treat it as a transient failure and reconnect with back-off.

## Endpoint Authentication

### Public Endpoints (No Auth)

These endpoints work without authentication:

| Endpoint                                  | Description                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/v1/pub/context`                 | Chain and market configuration      |
| `GET /api/v1/market-data/.../candles/...` | OHLCV candlestick data              |
| `GET /api/v1/market-data/.../funding/...` | Funding rate history of one market  |
| `GET /api/v1/market-data/funding/...`     | Funding rate history of all markets |
| `GET /api/v1/market-data/.../book`        | L2 order book snapshot              |
| `GET /api/v1/market-data/.../ticker`      | Current state of one market         |
| `GET /api/v1/market-data/ticker`          | Current state of all markets        |
| `GET /api/v1/profile/announcements`       | Public announcements                |
| `wss://.../ws/v1/market-data`             | Real-time market data streams       |

### Authenticated Endpoints (API Key)

These endpoints require a signed request from an enrolled API key (see [Authentication](/broken/pages/6451fe9ea080b784a1e900a84b80004c6003d02a)). A **read-only** key is sufficient unless the row says otherwise:

| Endpoint                               | Description                                                                                                                   |

### Testing

Create a key at the web UI ([app.perpl.xyz/apikeys](https://app.perpl.xyz/apikeys), testnet [testnet.perpl.xyz/apikeys](https://testnet.perpl.xyz/apikeys)) or enroll one programmatically, then run the examples in `examples/` (see [Examples](/broken/pages/a53ca637c3122d2de62345f55532499657444ab6)). The example programs read your enrolled key from `PERPL_API_KEY` / `PERPL_API_KEY_SECRET`, and the wallet used for enrollment from a private key you supply.

## API Auth vs Smart Contract Account

**This is a common source of confusion.** API authentication, smart contract account creation, and the on-chain permission to forward orders are three separate things:

| Concept                | What It Means                                                                                | Required For                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Authentication** | An enrolled API key can call authenticated API endpoints                                     | Reading order history, position history, trading WebSocket                      |
| **Exchange Account**   | On-chain account exists on Exchange contract with collateral                                 | Placing orders, holding positions, trading                                      |
| **Order Forwarding**   | The account has authorized the exchange to submit orders on its behalf ("one-click trading") | Posting orders on the trading WebSocket (not needed to trade directly on-chain) |

### Key Points

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
## API auth does NOT create an exchange account

* Enrolling an API key only authorizes API access for your wallet.
* A valid signed request means you can use authenticated API endpoints.
* It does **not** mean you can trade.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Exchange account must be created on-chain

* Call `createAccount(uint256 amountCNS)` on the Exchange contract.
* Requires initial collateral deposit (USDC).
* This creates your account ID.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Order forwarding must be enabled on-chain to trade via the API

* `createAccount` leaves forwarding **disabled**; a brand-new account cannot post orders through the API.
* Call `allowOrderForwarding(true)` on the Exchange contract from the account's own wallet.
* Every order placed through the API is forwarded (submitted and paid for) by the exchange on your behalf — this is the authorization for that, and without it the contract refuses the order.
* The flag gates only the forwarded path. An account can still trade by sending its own order transactions on-chain; that is out of scope for these docs.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## All three are required to trade through this API

* API auth → Access trading history, real-time data via authenticated endpoints.
* Exchange account → Hold collateral and positions.
* Order forwarding → Actually post orders on the trading WebSocket.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

On the front end, the "Deposit to Enable trading" button and the **One-Click Trading** toggle in user settings take care of steps 2 and 3.

### Fetch smart contract information

Fetch the smart contract information from the public API over http:

```typescript
    const accountCreationInfo = await getAccountCreationInfo(API_URL);
    console.log(accountCreationInfo);
    // Example output:
    // { 'account_open_min_deposit_display': '10.0 AUSD',
    //   'collateral_token_address': '0x00000000efe302beaa2b3e6e1b18d08d69a9012a',
    //   'collateral_token_symbol': 'AUSD',
    //   'min_account_open_amount': 100000000,
    //   'smart_contract_address': '0xSMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'
    // }
```

Example code is given in examples/\*/fetch\_smart\_contract\_info for JavaScript, Python, Rust and TypeScript.

### Checking Account Status

To make the API calls to the Smart Contract use Foundry: https://www.getfoundry.sh and fill in the environment variables with the information from the public API.

```bash
export SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xSmartContractAddress
export WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress
cast call --from $WALLET_ADDRESS $SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getAccountByAddr(address)(uint256)" $WALLET_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

This call returns the account id for an address if an account exists otherwise returns an execution reverted error.

### Creating an Exchange Account

Again, fill in the environment variables using the API output above and use cast to create the Smart Contract Account:

```bash
export SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xSmartContractAddress
export TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xCollateralTokenContractAddress
export WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress
export WALLET_KEY=0xYourWalletPrivateKey;
# Check API for current min account open amount
export MIN_ACCOUNT_OPEN_AMOUNT=100000000

# Approve deposit to DEX contract (ERC-20)
cast send --from $WALLET_ADDRESS $TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "approve(address,uint256)(bool)" $SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS $MIN_ACCOUNT_OPEN_AMOUNT --private-key $WALLET_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Create DEX account with initial deposit
cast send --from $WALLET_ADDRESS $SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "createAccount(uint256)(uint256)" $MIN_ACCOUNT_OPEN_AMOUNT --private-key $WALLET_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Enabling Order Forwarding (One-Click Trading)

**Order forwarding is what makes API trading possible.** An order placed on the trading WebSocket is never sent to the chain by the client: the exchange submits (forwards) the transaction on your behalf and pays the gas — gas-less, click-less trading. The Exchange contract only accepts forwarded orders for accounts that have explicitly authorized it, so this permission is a prerequisite for every order posted through this API, independent of API authentication.

It is **not** a prerequisite for trading itself. An account can always transact directly on-chain from its own wallet — submitting its own order transactions and paying its own gas — and that path is unaffected by the flag. Direct on-chain trading is out of scope for these docs; everything below assumes you are posting orders through the API.

A freshly created account has forwarding **disabled** — `createAccount` does not turn it on. Grant it by calling `allowOrderForwarding` from the account's own wallet:

```solidity
/// Sets whether the account permits the exchange Administrator role to forward orders on
/// its behalf. Enables gas-less, click-less trading.
function allowOrderForwarding(bool allow) external;
```

```bash
export SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xSmartContractAddress
export WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress
export WALLET_KEY=0xYourWalletPrivateKey

# Enable order forwarding (pass false to revoke it)
cast send --from $WALLET_ADDRESS $SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "allowOrderForwarding(bool)" true --private-key $WALLET_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

Notes:

* `msg.sender` must be the wallet that owns the exchange account; the call reverts if no account exists for it, or if the account is frozen.
* The permission is per-account and persistent — a one-time setup, not per-session. Pass `false` to revoke it; orders already on the book are unaffected, but no new order can be placed through the API until it is granted again.
* On success the contract emits `OrderForwardingUpdated(accountId, allowed)`.
* The front end exposes this as the **One-Click Trading** toggle in user settings.

**Checking the current state.** There is no on-chain getter for it — `getAccountByAddr` does not return the flag. Read `fw` on the [`Account`](/broken/pages/a35c61fcf85eaa8d16498afeebfd270f5e25a0c0#account) object instead: it arrives in the wallet snapshot (`as[]`) and in every account update (`mt: 21`) on the trading WebSocket. Because the flag can be toggled from any wallet client at any time, re-read `fw` on each `mt: 21` update rather than caching it from the snapshot.

**What a missing permission looks like.** The order is rejected before any transaction reaches the chain: the `mt: 22` frame is still acknowledged with `code: 0`, and the rejection arrives on the `mt: 24` order stream as `st: 7` (`Failed`) with `sr: 34` (`OrderForwardingNotAllowed`). No on-chain order id is assigned. See [Command Status](/broken/pages/daecbdc03d39e92516bbf05b8f6afe85bb178aae#command-status-mt-3) and [OrderStatusReason](/broken/pages/a35c61fcf85eaa8d16498afeebfd270f5e25a0c0#orderstatusreason).
