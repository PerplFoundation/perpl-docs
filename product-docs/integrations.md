# integrations

This page is for **third-party services** — trading terminals, bots, portfolio trackers — that integrate with Perpl on behalf of a user's wallet. It covers how to **enroll** an API key programmatically, and — for integrations that charge their own fee on the flow they route — how to use [**builder codes**](integrations.md#builder-codes).

{% hint style="info" %}
End users can create a key themselves from the web UI (**mainnet** https://app.perpl.xyz/apikeys, **testnet** https://testnet.perpl.xyz/apikeys) and paste the token into your app. Implement the programmatic flow below when you want to enroll keys directly from your integration.
{% endhint %}

Once a key is enrolled, see [**Authentication**](/broken/pages/6451fe9ea080b784a1e900a84b80004c6003d02a) for how to sign each request with it.

## How it works

An API key is an **Ed25519 key pair**. The server only ever stores the public key; the private key never leaves the client. Enrollment is authorized once by the user's wallet signature — after that, every request is signed with the key's private key (there is no bearer token or session cookie).

```

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
## Generate an Ed25519 key pair locally
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Enroll the public key

Request an EIP-712 payload, sign it with the user's wallet (proves account ownership) **and** with the API key (proves you hold the private key), then submit both signatures. The server returns an opaque `X-API-Key` token.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Scopes

A key is enrolled with a scope bitmask. Trade implies read. **Withdrawals and transfers-out are never permitted via an API key, regardless of scope.**

| `scope_mask` | Name            | Grants                                                      |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`          | `read`          | Read account, order, position, history, points/rewards data |
| `2`          | `trade`         | Place / cancel / modify orders (**implies read**)           |
| `3`          | `read \| trade` | Both                                                        |

### Delegated accounts

To enroll a key for a delegated account (an operator acting for another profile), set `target_profile` to the delegated account address. `address` remains the signing wallet (owner or operator); the server resolves and freezes the principal at enrollment and validates the delegation on-chain.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path                      | Auth             | Purpose                           |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/v1/api-key/payload` | Wallet signature | Get the EIP-712 payload to sign   |
| POST   | `/api/v1/api-key/enroll`  | Wallet signature | Enroll the key, receive the token |

{% hint style="info" %}
Listing and revoking keys is done from the web UI (`/apikeys`), not the API.
{% endhint %}

### Origin whitelisting

`/api-key/payload` and `/api-key/enroll` are CORS-enabled: they can be called from your backend **or directly from client-side (browser) code**. In **both** cases the request's `Origin` must be whitelisted by Perpl — enrollment records the `Origin` it was created from (returned as `ApiKeyInfo.origin`), and requests from a non-whitelisted `Origin` are rejected. Ask Perpl to whitelist the origin(s) your integration enrolls from.

* **From a browser** the `Origin` header is set automatically and cannot be overridden — just ensure the page's origin is whitelisted.
* **From a server** (e.g. Node) set the `Origin` header explicitly on the request, as shown below.

***

## Step 1: Generate an Ed25519 key pair

The public key is sent as raw 32 bytes, `0x`-hex encoded.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="TypeScript / JavaScript" %}
`@noble/ed25519`:

```typescript
import * as ed from '@noble/ed25519';

const privateKey = ed.utils.randomPrivateKey();          // 32 bytes, keep secret
const publicKey  = await ed.getPublicKeyAsync(privateKey); // 32 bytes
const publicKeyHex = '0x' + Buffer.from(publicKey).toString('hex');
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Shell" %}
OpenSSL 3.x:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out apikey.pem
# raw 32-byte public key as 0x-hex:
PUBKEY_HEX=0x$(openssl pkey -in apikey.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | xxd -p -c 64)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Step 2: Request the enrollment payload

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/api-key/payload`

**Request** (`ApiKeyPayloadRequest`):

```typescript
interface ApiKeyPayloadRequest {
  chain_id: number;        // 143 mainnet, 10143 testnet
  address: string;         // signer wallet (owner or operator of the account)
  public_key: string;      // Ed25519 public key, 0x-hex (32 bytes)
  scope_mask: number;      // 1=read, 2=trade, 3=both
  label: string;           // human-readable key label (required)
  expires_at?: number;     // ms timestamp, 0 / omitted = never
  ip_cidrs?: string[];     // optional IP allow-list (max 4 CIDRs)
  target_profile?: string; // delegated account, if enrolling for one

  // Builder codes only — see the Builder codes section below.
  builder_id?: number;               // your registered builder code, 1..255
  max_builder_fee_per_100k?: number; // fee ceiling the user authorizes, 1 = 0.1 bps
}
```

**Response** (`ApiKeyPayloadResponse`):

```typescript
interface ApiKeyPayloadResponse {
  typed_data: any;  // EIP-712 typed data — sign this exactly as returned
  mac: string;      // opaque; echo back unchanged in the enroll request
}
```

```typescript
const API_URL = process.env.PERPL_API_URL || 'https://app.perpl.xyz/api';
const ORIGIN = 'https://your-app.example';  // must be whitelisted by Perpl

const CHAIN_ID = Number(process.env.PERPL_CHAIN_ID) || 143;

// API key scope bitmask: 1 = read, 2 = trade (implies read), 3 = both.
const SCOPE_MASK = 3;

const payloadRes = await fetch(`${API_URL}/v1/api-key/payload`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Origin': ORIGIN,  // set from a server; in a browser the Origin is set automatically
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    chain_id: CHAIN_ID,
    address: '0xUserWalletAddress',
    public_key: publicKeyHex,
    scope_mask: SCOPE_MASK,
    label: 'my trading terminal',
  }),
});
const { typed_data, mac } = await payloadRes.json();
```

## Step 3: Sign and enroll

Enrollment requires **two** signatures over the returned `typed_data`:

1. **Wallet signature** — the wallet's secp256k1 EIP-712 signature. Proves the user owns (or operates) the account.
2. **Proof-of-possession** — an Ed25519 signature by the API private key over the EIP-712 digest `keccak256(0x1901 ‖ domainSeparator ‖ hashStruct(message))`. Proves you hold the private key for the public key being enrolled.

**TypeScript / JavaScript** (`ethers` v6 + `@noble/ed25519`):

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import * as ed from '@noble/ed25519';

// Illustrative only: an inline private key stands in for the signer here.
// Integrations are expected to sign with the user's CONNECTED wallet (e.g. a
// browser wallet via window.ethereum, or a wagmi/viem/ethers signer) — the
// private key never touches your code. Any EIP-712 signer works.
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet('0xUserWalletPrivateKey');

// ethers wants the EIP-712 types WITHOUT the EIP712Domain entry.
const { EIP712Domain, ...types } = typed_data.types;

// 1. Wallet secp256k1 EIP-712 signature (from the user's connected wallet).
const signature = await wallet.signTypedData(typed_data.domain, types, typed_data.message);

// 2. Ed25519 proof-of-possession over the EIP-712 digest.
const digest = ethers.TypedDataEncoder.hash(typed_data.domain, types, typed_data.message);
const popSig = await ed.signAsync(ethers.getBytes(digest), privateKey);
const popSignature = '0x' + Buffer.from(popSig).toString('hex');
```

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/api-key/enroll`

**Request** (`ApiKeyEnrollRequest`):

```typescript
interface ApiKeyEnrollRequest {
  chain_id: number;
  address: string;
  typed_data: any;        // echoed from the payload response, unchanged
  mac: string;            // echoed from the payload response, unchanged
  signature: string;      // wallet EIP-712 signature, 0x-hex
  pop_signature: string;  // Ed25519 proof-of-possession, 0x-hex
  target_profile?: string;
}
```

**Response** (`ApiKeyEnrollResponse`): the enrolled key. `api_key.api_key` is the opaque token you send as `X-API-Key` — **store it, it is not re-derivable**.

```typescript
interface ApiKeyInfo {
  api_key: string;       // opaque X-API-Key token
  address: string;
  scope_mask: number;
  label: string;
  ip_cidrs: string[];
  origin: string;        // HTTP Origin the key was enrolled from
  expires_at: number;    // ms, 0 = never
  last_used_at: number;  // ms, 0 = never
  created_at: number;    // ms

  // Builder terms, present only on a builder-bound key.
  builder_id?: number;                // the code the key submits under
  builder_name?: string;              // registered display name
  max_builder_fee_per_100k?: number;  // enrolled ceiling, 1 = 0.1 bps
  max_builder_fee_pct?: string;       // the same ceiling formatted, e.g. "0.100%"
}
```

```typescript
const enrollRes = await fetch(`${API_URL}/v1/api-key/enroll`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Origin': ORIGIN,  // same whitelisted Origin as the payload request
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    chain_id: CHAIN_ID,
    address: '0xUserWalletAddress',
    typed_data,
    mac,
    signature,
    pop_signature: popSignature,
  }),
});
const { api_key } = await enrollRes.json();
const API_KEY = api_key.api_key; // the X-API-Key token — hand this to the request signer
```

**Enroll status codes**:

| Code | Meaning                                                                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 404  | Target profile not found                                                                 |
| 409  | Public key already registered (revoked keys can't be re-enrolled — use a fresh key pair) |
| 423  | Per-profile key limit reached (max 16 active keys)                                       |

Listing and revoking keys is done from the web UI (`/apikeys`), not the API. A revoked public key cannot be re-enrolled — generate a fresh key pair.

## Builder codes

A **builder code** identifies your integration to Perpl. It lets you charge your own fee on the orders you route — on top of the protocol fee, attributed to your code and settled to you — and gives you volume attribution even when you charge nothing. Builder codes are optional: everything above works without one.

Three things have to line up:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
## Perpl registers your builder code

[Registering as a builder](integrations.md#registering-as-a-builder).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Each user's key is enrolled bound to that code

The user signs for a fee ceiling — [Enrolling a builder-bound key](integrations.md#enrolling-a-builder-bound-key).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Each order states the fee it wants to charge

The fee must be within that ceiling — [Charging a builder fee](integrations.md#charging-a-builder-fee).
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Fee units

Builder fees are expressed in **hundred-thousandths** (`per_100k`). `1` = 0.1 bps = 0.001%.

{% hint style="info" %}
Not the same unit as the market fee rates on the API, which are in **micros** (`10^-6`) — see [Fees & fee tiers](/broken/pages/420850a9cc70d23e5e7ca5773d00acb193495ad8#fees--fee-tiers). `1 per_100k` = `10 micros`.
{% endhint %}

| `per_100k` | bps | percent |
| ---------- | --- | ------- |
| `1`        | 0.1 | 0.001%  |
| `10`       | 1   | 0.01%   |
| `100`      | 10  | 0.1%    |
| `1000`     | 100 | 1%      |

The maximum a key can be enrolled with is `100` (0.1%).

### Registering as a builder

**Contact Perpl to register.** Builder codes are issued by the operator; there is no self-service endpoint. You provide:

|                           |                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Display name**          | Shown to _your users_ in the wallet prompt when they authorize a key (see below) |
| **Perpl account address** | The address of your Perpl account your accrued builder fees are paid out to.     |

You receive a **builder id** in `1..255` (the id is a `uint8` on-chain, so the registry is deliberately small).

### Enrolling a builder-bound key

Same two-step flow as above — the only difference is two extra fields on the **payload** request. `builder_id` cannot be attached to an already-enrolled key; it is frozen at enrollment and covered by the user's signature.

```typescript
const BUILDER_ID = Number(process.env.PERPL_BUILDER_ID) || 0;
const MAX_BUILDER_FEE = Number(process.env.PERPL_MAX_BUILDER_FEE_PER_100K) || 0;

const payloadRes = await fetch(`${API_URL}/v1/api-key/payload`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Origin': ORIGIN },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    chain_id: CHAIN_ID,
    address: '0xUserWalletAddress',
    public_key: publicKeyHex,
    scope_mask: SCOPE_MASK,
    label: 'my trading terminal',
    builder_id: BUILDER_ID,                     // your registered code
    max_builder_fee_per_100k: MAX_BUILDER_FEE,  // ceiling: 100 (0.1%) per order
  }),
});
```

All failures are `400`:

| Condition                                                | Message                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `builder_id` outside `1..255`                            | `builder_id must be in 1..255`                      |
| `max_builder_fee_per_100k` above the environment ceiling | `max_builder_fee_per_100k must be at most <N>`      |
| `max_builder_fee_per_100k` without a `builder_id`        | `max_builder_fee_per_100k requires a builder_id`    |
| Non-zero fee ceiling on a `read`-only key                | `max_builder_fee_per_100k requires the trade scope` |
| Code not registered / not enabled                        | `builder code <N> is not registered`                |
| Builder enrollment not enabled in that environment       | `builder-bound api keys are not enabled`            |

`max_builder_fee_per_100k: 0` with a `builder_id` is valid and useful: **attribution without a fee**. It is also the only shape a `read`-scoped builder key can take — such a key can never place an order.

#### What the user signs

**The signer is the end user, not you.** You generate the Ed25519 key pair and supply the proof-of-possession; the user's wallet signs the EIP-712 payload. That signature _is_ the fee authorization — there is no separate builder-side approval step — so the payload is written to be legible in the wallet prompt:

* the machine-enforced terms are EIP-712 fields (`builderId`, `maxBuilderFeePer100K`), and
* the same terms in prose are in the payload's `statement` field, naming your registered builder name and the ceiling as a percentage. This is what the user actually reads before approving.

`/api-key/enroll` **re-derives that statement** from the registry and rejects the enrollment if it does not match the one signed. The practical consequence: if your builder name changes between the payload and the enroll call, the enrollment fails — request a fresh payload and have the user sign again.

The enroll response echoes the terms back (`builder_id`, `builder_name`, `max_builder_fee_per_100k`, `max_builder_fee_pct`) so you can confirm you registered what you intended. Users see the same fields for every key on their `/apikeys` page and can revoke any key there at any time — consent is granted once, visibility and revocation are continuous.

### Charging a builder fee

Orders are placed over the trading WebSocket (`mt: 22`, see [WebSocket → Placing Orders](/broken/pages/daecbdc03d39e92516bbf05b8f6afe85bb178aae#placing-orders)). A builder-bound key adds one field:

```typescript
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  mt: 22,
  sn: 1,
  rq: Date.now(),      // idempotency key, strictly increasing per account
  mkt: 1, acc: accountId,   // BTC (mainnet)
  t: 1,                // OpenLong
  p: 0, s: 10000,      // market order, 0.1 BTC
  fl: 0, lv: 1000,     // GTC, 10x leverage
  lb: head + market.order_ttl_blocks,
  bf: 50,              // builder fee: 5 bps, must be <= the key's ceiling
}));
```

* **There is no `builder_id` on the request.** The code comes from the authenticating key. A client that could name its own code could attribute another builder's flow to itself.
* **The enrolled ceiling is a maximum, not a default.** Set `bf` on every order you want to charge for. Omitting it is _not_ an error: the order executes, attributed to your code, at zero fee — you simply earn nothing on it.
* **A fee above the ceiling is rejected, not clamped.** Silently reducing it would make your accounting disagree with the chain.
* The fee applies to **every fill that changes the position's size**, closes and reductions included — it follows the account fee. It is charged on the size the fill added or removed.
* Builder fees only exist on orders routed through the API. Orders a user sends directly on-chain cannot be attributed to a builder.

Rejections arrive as the usual `mt: 3` status, and no `mt: 24` update follows:

| `error`                                      | Condition                                                      | `code` |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `builder fee not permitted for this api key` | `bf` above the key's ceiling, or any `bf` on a non-builder key | 400    |
| `api key lacks trade scope`                  | `read`-scoped key                                              | 403    |

### Reconciling what was charged

Fees are reported **gross**: the `f` (fee) amount on orders, fills and account events is the total the user paid, protocol fee **plus** builder fee. The builder portion is broken out alongside it, so never add the two together.

| Field | On                                                    | Meaning                                        |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `bfa` | `Fill` (`mt: 25`), `Order` (`mt: 24`), `AccountEvent` | Builder-fee portion of that event's `f`        |
| `tbf` | `AccountStats`                                        | Lifetime builder fees inside `tf` (total fees) |

Both are omitted when zero, so an ordinary (non-builder) account sees no change. A mis-integration is visible within one fill: flow that reaches you with `bf` unset shows up as volume with `bfa: 0`.

### Getting paid

Accrued builder fees are collected per builder code and settled to the Perpl account registered with your code, on a periodic epoch schedule.

## Next steps

Once you hold an `X-API-Key` token and its Ed25519 private key, sign every request as described in [**Authentication**](/broken/pages/6451fe9ea080b784a1e900a84b80004c6003d02a). Runnable enrollment + signing programs for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and Rust are in [`examples/`](/broken/pages/a53ca637c3122d2de62345f55532499657444ab6).
